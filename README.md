# Markdown Editor

This project is created by this instruction :
1.	When the user clicks on a video, file, image it should open a modal window with a predefined list of each item type. Some array from component, page, etc. Better class list.
2.	This modal window has the ability to choose something from a list: image, video, file.
3.	Image, video or file will appear as new special markups in markdown editor.
4.	In modal form also it is possible to upload a new image, new photo or new video. For this, you should have a callback function which returns a Promise and new object inside: remote image, remote video or remote file. It is an emulation of server connect. 
    1.	The user should be able to upload the image/video as an array
    2.	The user should be able to insert image/video/files as list items(multiple checkboxes)
5.	Markdown components have predefined content with all element examples inside and possible to change it.
6.	Markdown should have the same look as in figma designed.
7.	Should be used vuetifyjs
8.	Should be used eslint, with plugins for Vue.
9.	We should be able to see HTML version of the compiled markdown editor
